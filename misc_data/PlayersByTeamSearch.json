In 2011 he signed with Málaga and, two years later, joined Arsenal, winning three FA Cup trophies with the latter club.\r\n\r\nA full international since 2009, Monreal represented Spain at the 2013 Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\r\n\r\nA product of CA Osasuna's youth ranks, Monreal was born in Pamplona, and made his official debut for his hometown club in an away game against Valencia CF on 22 October 2006, in a 0–1 La Liga loss. He finished his first season with ten league appearances, adding two in the campaign's UEFA Champions League; after the Navarrese's relegation to the UEFA Cup, he appeared in four matches as the team reached the last four, being eliminated by fellow league side Sevilla FC.\r\n\r\nMonreal became first-choice in 2007–08, retaining that status in the subsequent seasons, with another youth product, César Azpilicueta, being the undisputed starter in the other defensive wing.\r\n\r\nMálaga\r\nOn 10 June 2011, Monreal signed a five-year contract with Málaga CF on a €6 million transfer fee. In his first season he initially battled for first-choice status with Eliseu, but ended up only missing seven games as the club finished fourth and qualified for the Champions League for the first time.\r\n\r\nMonreal scored his only goal for the Andalusians on 27 January 2013, in a 3–2 away win against RCD Mallorca.\r\n\r\nArsenal\r\nMonreal marking Florian Thauvin during a Champions League match against Marseille in November 2013\r\nOn 31 January 2013, Monreal joined English side Arsenal on a long-term contract. He was given the number 17 shirt. The fee was undisclosed, but was believed by Sky Sports to be around £8.5 million. He made his Premier League debut against Stoke City two days later in a 1–0 home win.\r\n\r\nOn 23 February 2013, Monreal provided the assist for fellow countryman Santi Cazorla to score the winner in a 2–1 victory over Aston Villa. He scored his first goal for the Gunners on 16 March, opening the scoring in a 2–0 win at Swansea City.\r\n\r\nMonreal returned from injury on 21 August 2013 to feature in Arsenal's 3–0 win at Fenerbahçe SK in the Champions League group stage play-off, playing the last three minutes in the place of Theo Walcott. On 26 September, he scored the deciding penalty in a shootout against West Bromwich Albion to send his team into the fourth round of the League Cup.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Alexis Sánchez in the 2014 off-season, Monreal took the vacant number 18 previously worn by Sébastien Squillaci. On 23 August, he assisted Olivier Giroud's late equalizer in a 2–2 draw against Everton. Additionally, an injury crisis in the squad saw him being deployed in an unfamiliar central defender role in a string of games, after Laurent Koscielny was put out of action due to an Achilles tendon injury.\r\n\r\nOn 9 March 2015, Monreal scored the opening goal in a 2–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford that put Arsenal through to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. He played the full 90 minutes in the final, a 4–0 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.\r\n\r\nOn 19 January 2016, Monreal signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal. On 23 April 2017, he scored the vital equalizer as his team came from behind to defeat Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.\r\n\r\nOn 6 November 2017, after good performances on the left side of a three-man defence, Monreal won the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Month award for October of that year. The following 20 January, he netted once and made two assists before retiring injured 30 minutes into an eventual 4–1 home win against Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\n\r\nMonreal taking on Chile's Eduardo Vargas in a 2013 friendly\r\nIn 2007, Monreal earned his first call for the Spain under-21 team. He started all their matches in the 2009 UEFA European Championship, in an eventual group stage exit.\r\n\r\nOn 6 August 2009, Monreal was selected to the senior side for the first time, for an exhibition game with Macedonia. He played the last 15 minutes for Joan Capdevila in a 3–2 away success; on 7 September 2010, in the nation's second game after they won the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, he played the entire 1–4 friendly loss to Argentina.\r\n\r\nMonreal was a member of the Spanish squad which reached the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil, although he was second-choice left back behind FC Barcelona's Jordi Alba. He started in the last two group games, beginning with a 10–0 win over Tahiti at the Maracanã in which he set up a David Villa goal.\r\n\r\nMonreal scored his first goal for Spain on 12 November 2016, contributing to a 4–0 defeat of Macedonia for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in Granada.

On transfer deadline day of summer 2013, he moved to Arsenal for a club-record fee of £42.5 million. The transfer makes him the most expensive German football player of all time.\r\nÖzil is acclaimed for his finesse and improvisation as an attacking midfielder.

He spent the 2015–16 season on loan at Ipswich Town. Internationally, he has represented England from under-17 to under-21 level.\r\n\r\nBorn in Goodmayes, London, Maitland-Niles is a product of Arsenal's Hale End Academy having joined the club at the age of 6. Maitland-Niles made the step up to Arsenal's U21s during the 2013–14 season, having broken into the U18 set up the season before. He signed his first professional contract with Arsenal on 24 October 2014.\r\n\r\nOn 9 December 2014, Maitland-Niles made his professional debut at the age of 17 years and 102 days in a UEFA Champions League match against Galatasaray, replacing Aaron Ramsey at half time in an eventual 4–1 win for Arsenal. In doing so he became the second youngest player to have represented Arsenal in the Champions League, behind Jack Wilshere. Four days later, he made his Premier League debut, replacing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in added time in a 4–1 win against Newcastle United.\r\n\r\nIpswich Town (loan)\r\nOn 2 July 2015, Maitland-Niles signed for Ipswich Town on a season-long loan for the 2015–16 season. Upon joining the club, he was given a number seven shirt ahead of a new season.\r\n\r\nMaitland-Niles made his Ipswich Town debut, starting the whole game before being substituted in the 82nd minutes, in a 2–2 draw against Brentford in the opening game of the season. Since making his Ipswich Town debut, Maitland-Niles' performances immediately made an impact and was praised by manager Mick McCarthy, describing him as \"outstanding\". His performance then saw him being named the club's player of the month for September. He scored his first goal for Ipswich and his first ever senior goal in a 2–0 win over Bolton Wanderers on 3 November 2015. His second goal for the club came on 19 January 2016, in a 2–1 loss against Portsmouth in the third round replay of the FA Cup. Later in the season, however, Maitland-Niles' first team opportunities was soon limited, due to injuries and competitions, leading him to play for the reserve side. After making thirty-two appearances and scoring two times in all competitions, Maitland-Niles returned to his parent club.\r\n\r\nReturn to Arsenal\r\nOn his return to Arsenal the following season, Maitland-Niles started a match away at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest in the EFL Cup at right-back. Maitland-Niles again started at centre midfield against Southampton in an FA Cup fourth-round game in an eventual 5–0 win for Arsenal. He came on in the 74th minute as Arsenal was victorious by a 2–0 margin against Sutton United in the fifth round of the cup.\r\n\r\nMaitland-Niles established himself as a regular first team player in Arsene Wenger's final season as manager of the club, making 28 total appearances in all competitions. On 12 June 2018, he signed a long term contract at Arsenal. On 12 August 2018, in Unai Emery's first match as manager, Maitland-Niles started at left-back. However, he would be subbed off 35 minutes into the match after suffering a broken leg.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nMaitland-Niles has played for England at various levels within the youth setup of the Three Lions. He made three appearances for England U17 in 2014.\r\n\r\nHe was then called up by England U18 in November 2014 and scored on his debut, in a 3–2 win over Poland U18. He went on to make four appearance for the England U18 side.\r\n\r\nIn September 2015, Maitland-Niles was called up by England U19 and scored on his England U19 debut, in a 3–2 win over Germany U19 on 4 September 2015. He scored again the following month, in a 2–0 win over Macedonia U19. He was then included in the England U19 squad for the UEFA European Under-19 Championship that saw them reached the semi-final of the tournament.\r\n\r\nOn 1 September 2016, Maitland-Niles scored on his England U20 debut, in a 1–1 draw against Brazil U20. In May 2017 he was called up to England's squad for the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup in South Korea. England eventually got to the final of the tournament where they were up against Venezuela. Maitland-Niles, who came on in the 75th minute of play, went on to raise the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup as England beat Venezuela by a 1–0 margin. This triumph also served to be the first time that England have ever won the Under 20 World Cup.\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\nMaitland-Niles said he credited God and his family for his football career. He also said he preferred playing in the centre of midfield, describing it as \"his natural position.\"","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strSide":"Right","strPosition":"Midfielder","strCollege":null,"strFacebook":"","strWebsite":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strYoutube":"","strHeight":"5 ft 10 in (1.77 m)","strWeight":"","intLoved":"0","strThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/thumb\/3775d71510853007.jpg","strCutout":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/cutout\/ukdxln1557050916.png","strRender":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/render\/dey8ix1557515958.png","strBanner":null,"strFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/fanart\/vrpsvw1432691066.jpg","strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCreativeCommons":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idPlayer":"34147055","idTeam":"133604","idTeamNational":null,"idSoccerXML":"9","idPlayerManager":null,"strNationality":"Scotland","strPlayer":"Kieran Tierney","strTeam":"Arsenal","strTeamNational":null,"strSport":"Soccer","intSoccerXMLTeamID":"54","dateBorn":"1997-06-05","strNumber":"","dateSigned":"2014-07-01","strSigning":"£25m","strWage":"","strOutfitter":"","strKit":"","strAgent":"","strBirthLocation":"Douglas, Isle of Man","strDescriptionEN":"Kieran Tierney (born 5 June 1997) is a Scottish footballer who plays for Arsenal and the Scotland national team as a left back.\r\n\r\nClub career\r\nEarly life and youth football\r\nBorn in Douglas on the Isle of Man, Tierney moved to Wishaw in Scotland aged 10 months. He supported Celtic as a child and signed for the club when he was 7 years old — he has spoken of his hope of emulating the late Tommy Gemmell, a member of the Lisbon Lions team who also grew up in Wishaw and played in the same position.\r\n\r\nHe progressed through the various youth ranks and earned a reputation as a dependable wide player in the club's development squad, both in defence and attack. He travelled with the first team squad on a pre-season trip to Finland in August 2014, and made his debut in a friendly against Tottenham Hotspur there. Although Celtic lost, Tierney described his first appearance for the first team as a \"dream come true\". He continued to play in the development squad throughout 2014–15, and in October 2014 during a Development League match against Heart of Midlothian he scored a goal from the edge of his own penalty box.\r\n\r\nDebut and breakthrough\r\nTierney made his competitive senior debut for Celtic on 22 April 2015 under manager Ronny Deila, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute in a Scottish Premiership match against Dundee. He made one further first team appearance that season, playing over an hour in a league match away at St Johnstone.\r\n\r\nTierney enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2015–16, appearing in over 30 matches and displacing the more experienced Emilio Izaguirre as first-choice left back. For his performances he was awarded with both the Players' and Writers' Young Player annual awards, while Celtic also won the league title. Despite interest from Premier League clubs, Tierney signed a new five-year contract on 24 June 2016, keeping him at Parkhead until 2021.\r\n\r\n2016–17\r\nAfter making his first appearances in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, Tierney suffered ankle ligament damage during training on 27 October 2016 and was initially ruled out of action for two months. During the layoff, which caused him to miss the League Cup Final, he received treatment on a recurring shoulder injury and attended several Celtic matches as a typical supporter in the company of his childhood friends.\r\n\r\nOn 22 January 2017, after missing three months, he made his long-awaited return to the Celtic team in a Scottish Cup tie against Albion Rovers. Tierney was crowned PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year for the second consecutive season on 7 May, making him the first to achieve this since Craig Levein in 1986. He suffered a jaw injury early in the 2017 Scottish Cup Final and had to be substituted for treatment. Celtic won the match 2–1 to complete a domestic treble and perfect season. In spite of his lengthy injury absence, he featured in 40 matches during the campaign.\r\n\r\n2017–18\r\nOn 8 August 2017 Tierney was named as captain while also moving to central defender to command a back line of teenagers in a Scottish League Cup fixture against Kilmarnock; Celtic won the game 5–0, with Tierney providing an assist and scoring with a \"wonderful strike\" from 40 yards.

On 26 October 2005, he made his debut for AEK in a Greek Cup match against PAS Giannina, scoring in the seventh minute of the game to help lead AEK to a 3–0 win.\r\n\r\nArsenal\r\nOn 2 July 2018, Arsenal announced that Papastathopoulos has agreed a long-term contract with the club for a reported fee £17.6 million and will wear the number 5 shirt. On 12 August 2018, he made his official debut with the club as a starter, at Emirates in a 2–0 loss against champions Manchester City. On 4 October 2018, Papastathopoulos scored his first for the club, setting the Gunners on their way to a comfortable 3–0 victory over Qarabag in the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage. After just four minutes of play in Baku, the centre-back was left unmarked inside the opposing penalty area, deflecting the ball home after the initial header fell into his path. Papastathopoulos, was named to the UEFA Europa League Team of the Week.\r\n\r\nOn 15 October 2018, Papastathopoulos was forced off during Greece’s 2–0 defeat to Finland and was believed to have sprained his ankle. Papastathopoulos was at the heart of Unai Emery’s defence since the Spaniard took over the reins in the summer and a fixture in a winning run of nine matches.  On 21 February 2019, he netted his second goal as an Arsenal player, taking advantage of a missed punch from BATE Borisov's goalie Denis Scherbitskiy to head the ball into an empty net following a corner kick from Granit Xhaka. The goal sealed a 3–0 home win for Arsenal, sending them through to the round of 32 in the 2018-19 UEFA Europa League.\r\n\r\nOn 12 April 2019, Papastathopoulos was named to the UEFA Europa League’s ‘Team of the week’, a second time during the season, after playing a vital role in Arsenal’s 2-0 win over Napoli in their quarterfinal first leg matchup. Papastathopoulos was one of four Arsenal players selected in the Europa League ‘Team of the week’ along with Petr Cech, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, and Aaron Ramsey. On 24 April 2019, Papastathopoulos scored his maiden goal in the English Premier League rose highest to connect with a corner from the right wing, masterfully heading the ball into the net from point blank range, but Arsenal slipped to a 1-3 defeat against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nPapastathopoulos playing for Greece in 2013\r\nPapastathopoulos was called up for the Greek senior team on 1 February 2008 and made his debut on 5 February 2008 in the 1–0 friendly victory against the Czech Republic. The Greece squad for UEFA Euro 2008 was announced by Otto Rehhagel on 27 May 2008, and Papastathopoulos was the unfortunate player to be cut from the provisional squad of 24 to the final 23-man selection.\r\n\r\nPapastathopoulos became the first player to be sent off at UEFA Euro 2012 during the opening game of the tournament against co-hosts Poland after receiving two yellow cards, following what pundits decried as two poor decisions by referee Carlos Velasco Carballo.\r\n\r\nIn June 2014, Papastathopoulos was named to Greece's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He started in each of the team's group matches, helping them to a clean sheet against Japan. In the round of 16, Papastathopoulos scored his first international goal, equalising in second half stoppage time against Costa Rica. However, the Greeks were eventually defeated 5–3 in a penalty shootout by the Central American champions.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strSide":"Right","strPosition":"Defender","strCollege":null,"strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/SokratisPapastathopoulos\/","strWebsite":"","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/SokratisPapa5","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/sokratispapa.official","strYoutube":"","strHeight":"1.86 m (6 ft 1 in)","strWeight":"","intLoved":"0","strThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/thumb\/tx5vqq1544985296.jpg","strCutout":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/cutout\/laley31557051136.png","strRender":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/render\/y3btbd1557515450.png","strBanner":null,"strFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/fanart\/f32um51557497157.jpg","strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCreativeCommons":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idPlayer":"34154870","idTeam":"133604","idTeamNational":null,"idSoccerXML":"9","idPlayerManager":null,"strNationality":"Armenia","strPlayer":"Henrikh Mkhitaryan","strTeam":"Arsenal","strTeamNational":null,"strSport":"Soccer","intSoccerXMLTeamID":"57","dateBorn":"1989-01-21","strNumber":"7","dateSigned":"2013-07-01","strSigning":"Swap deal","strWage":"£9,360,000 (£180,000 a week)","strOutfitter":"","strKit":"adidas Predator 19+","strAgent":"Mino Raiola","strBirthLocation":"Yerevan, Armenian SSR, Soviet Union","strDescriptionEN":"Henrikh Mkhitaryan  born 21 January 1989) is an Armenian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Arsenal, as well as captaining the Armenia national team. Mkhitaryan is Armenia's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 19 goals in 59 international matches since his debut in January 2007, including their first hat-trick. His previous clubs include Pyunik, where he came through the youth system, Metalurh Donetsk, Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Dortmund.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan has been chosen Armenian Footballer of the Year five times (every year since 2009, except 2010). In 2012 he was voted as the best Shakhtar player of 2011–12 season by the fans, and Ukraine Premier League MVP. In 2012, Mkhitaryan was named in UEFA's Top 100 players by UEFA European Football Yearbook 2012–13. Mkhitaryan was voted the CIS Footballer of the Year for 2012, making him the first Armenian footballer to be named the best player from post-Soviet countries. He received the award again for 2013. Mkhitaryan received the nickname Heno from his fans in Armenia and has been nicknamed Micki by his Borussia Dortmund fans.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan was born on 21 January 1989 in the Armenian capital Yerevan to Marina Taschyan and Hamlet Mkhitaryan, a prominent striker of FC Ararat Yerevan during the 1980s, who died of a brain tumor at age 33 when Mkhitaryan was seven years old. His mother is the head of the national teams department in the Armenian Football Federation and his elder sister, Monica, works at UEFA's headquarters.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Mkhitaryan family moved to France, where Hamlet Mkhitaryan played for the now defunct ASOA Valence and helped them to be promoted to the second division Ligue 2. Mkhitaryan spent his early childhood in Valence. He always wanted to become a football player and began to follow in his father's footsteps. As a child, he would watch his father play and always wanted to follow him to training. The Mkhitaryans returned to Yerevan in 1995. In the same year Mkhitaryan joined the youth system of FC Pyunik. He graduated from the Institute of Physical Culture in Armenia. He studied economics at the Yerevan branch of the St. Petersburg Institute. Upon graduation, he plans to study there as a lawyer. In 2003, Mkhitaryan, aged 14 had trials with São Paulo in Brazil where he played alongside the likes of Hernanes and Oscar. He returned back to Pyunik in 2004, then manager Mihai Stoichiță insisted on his return to Armenia. Growing up, Mkhitaryan considered Zinedine Zidane his football idol.\r\n\r\nMkhitaryan is an attacking midfielder capable of playing second striker as well. He thrives playing just behind the strikers, where he always looks to link up with his teammates in and around the box. Tearing apart opposition defences time and time again, he makes space for the striker\/wingers to exploit and create goal scoring opportunities. Mkhitaryan has been praised for his technique, movement, accurate passing, dribbling, creativity, ball control and work rate. He is equipped with a dangerous shot, trickery to beat defenders, and a superb vision to go for the pass.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2012–13 season, former Scottish footballer Pat Nevin said of Mkhitaryan, \"Eleven goals in eight league matches already is fantastic, but when you add that he is a midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you soon will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard.

Swiss national manager Ottmar Hitzfeld once dubbed him the \"young Schweinsteiger\", while former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou has praised his tackling, versatility, and physicality.\r\n\r\nXhaka began his career at hometown club Basel, winning the Swiss Super League in both of his seasons. He then moved to Bundesliga team Borussia Mönchengladbach in 2012, playing 140 official games and scoring nine goals.\r\n\r\nHe has been a full international for Switzerland since 2011, gaining more than 40 caps. He was included in their squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.\r\n\r\nXhaka was born in Basel, Switzerland to Kosovo Albanian parents and is the younger brother of Taulant Xhaka, who is also a professional footballer and plays for the Albania national football team and played against Granit in the second Euro 2016 match. Their family moved from Kosovo to Switzerland shortly before their children were born.\r\n\r\nThe brothers started their youth football by Concordia Basel and both moved to Basel in 2002. Xhaka played for various Basel youth teams and since 2008 has been a member of the U-21 squad. Between 2008 and 2010 he played 37 games for the U-21 team, scoring eleven goals.\r\n\r\nBefore making his international debut for Switzerland, Xhaka was still undecided whether to play for his birth country or Albania, and he complained to the Albanian sports media that FSHF was ignoring him while the Swiss Football Association was showing much more interest.\r\n\r\nXhaka debuted for Switzerland at Wembley Stadium against England, in a 2–2 UEFA Euro 2012 qualification draw on 4 June 2011. On 15 November of the same year, during his sixth international appearance, he scored his first international goal in the 1–0 away win against Luxembourg in Stade Josy Barthel.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland also tried to select him to participate in the 2012 Olympic Football tournament, but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training. Xhaka participated in all ten of Switzerland's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign matches, scoring both goals in a 2–0 defeat of Slovenia.\r\n\r\nOn 2 June 2014, Xhaka was named in Switzerland's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad by national coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. In the team's second match, Xhaka scored in a 5–2 loss to France.\r\n\r\nXhaka was selected for UEFA Euro 2016, where Switzerland's campaign opened against Albania in Lens. Xhaka, whose team won 1–0, was playing against his own brother while their mother watched from the crowd in a t-shirt blending the two nations' flags. He was voted the man of the match. Xhaka played every minute of Switzerland's campaign, which ended in the last 16 with a loss to Poland at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard; after a 1–1 draw he was the only player to not score in the penalty shootout, shooting wide.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strSide":"Left","strPosition":"Midfielder","strCollege":null,"strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/GranitXhaka\/","strWebsite":"","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/xhakagranit34","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/granitxhaka","strYoutube":"","strHeight":"1.85 m (6 ft 1 in)","strWeight":"","intLoved":"0","strThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/thumb\/gmva7w1510860115.jpg","strCutout":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/cutout\/dqa0j21557051335.png","strRender":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/render\/gtrsbd1564918610.png","strBanner":null,"strFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/fanart\/5m2yxc1557498138.jpg","strFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/fanart\/nihmcz1557515056.jpg","strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCreativeCommons":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idPlayer":"34160886","idTeam":"133604","idTeamNational":null,"idSoccerXML":"9","idPlayerManager":null,"strNationality":"Egypt","strPlayer":"Mohamed Elneny","strTeam":"Arsenal","strTeamNational":null,"strSport":"Soccer","intSoccerXMLTeamID":null,"dateBorn":"1992-07-11","strNumber":"4","dateSigned":null,"strSigning":"12,50 Mill. €","strWage":"£2,600,000 (£50,000 a week)","strOutfitter":"","strKit":"adidas Predator 19+","strAgent":"Base Soccer Agency Ltd","strBirthLocation":"El-Mahalla El-Kubra, Egypt","strDescriptionEN":"Mohamed Naser Elsayed Elneny (also transliterated El Nenny, Arabic: محمد ناصر السيد النني‎‎; born 11 July 1992) is an Egyptian footballer who plays for English club Arsenal and the Egypt national team.\r\n\r\nHe began his senior career at El Mokawloon and moved to Basel in January 2013.

He made his senior debut in Serie B on 16 May 2015 against Varese, playing the game in the starting line-up. In this game, he played 58 minutes before he was replaced with Matteo Politano. He played five games including promotion playoffs in the season.\r\n\r\nSampdoria\r\nOn 1 July 2015, Torreira transferred to Sampdoria for €1.5 million, but he remained with Pescara on loan for the 2015–16 season to gain first-team experience.\r\n\r\nPescara (loan)\r\nOn 2 July 2015, he was loaned to Pescara.

Upon the completion of the signing, head coach Unai Emery said \"In Lucas Torreira, we have signed a young player who is a very bright talent in the game. A midfielder with great quality, I have enjoyed watching his performances for Sampdoria in the past two seasons, and we all saw him do very well for Uruguay in the World Cup. He is a young player already with good experience, but who wants to keep on growing.\" Torreira was given the number 11 shirt, previously worn by Mesut Özil, who took the vacant number 10, following the departure of Jack Wilshere.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nTorreira was called up to full Uruguay squad for the 2018 China Cup in March 2018.

He began at Lorca Deportiva CF, where he achieved promotion to the Segunda División in his first season, and was awarded the Miguel Muñoz Trophy. He then joined Almería, who he led to promotion to La Liga for the first time in the club's history. This earned him a move to La Liga heavyweights Valencia, where he regularly led the team to top three finishes. After leaving Valencia, he coached Spartak Moscow for six months, before moving to Sevilla in 2013.\r\n\r\nAt Sevilla, Emery gained plaudits for his style of football, and shrewdness in the transfer market alongside Monchi, the club's director of football. He achieved an unprecedented three consecutive Europa League victories, which earned him a move to French club Paris Saint-Germain in 2016. Although he achieved limited European success at PSG, he won the Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions in his first year.

But he began his professional career playing as an outfield player with Poitiers in the Championnat de France Amateur 2 (fifth tier) in 2012–13.\r\n\r\nAngers\r\nHe signed for Angers in 2013, and spent his first season with the reserves in the CFA 2.\r\n\r\nHe made his professional debut in the second round of the Coupe de la Ligue in a 2–1 home loss to Arles-Avignon on 26 August 2014, as a 73rd-minute substitute for Yohann Eudeline. His first Ligue 2 match was on 21 November 2014, starting in a 1–1 Ligue 2 draw away to Ajaccio.\r\n\r\nPépé was loaned to Orléans for the 2015–16 Championnat National, and helped the club to promotion from the third tier as runners-up. He returned to an Angers side playing in Ligue 1 and which reached the 2017 Coupe de France Final, where he started in a 1–0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade de France.\r\n\r\nLille\r\nOn 21 June 2017, Pépé signed a five-year deal with Lille, for a maximum transfer fee of €10 million, after being signed by head coach Marcelo Bielsa who had scouted the player by watching footage of every Ligue 1 game he had played in for Angers, before scouting him in person. Pépé described Bielsa as \"special\" and a \"great coach\". He started the season playing as a striker after being converted into playing the position under Bielsa, before finishing the season under the new Lille head coach Christophe Galtier playing as a winger.\r\n\r\nDuring the entirety of the 2017–18 Ligue 1 season, he was a regular in a Lille side that narrowly avoided relegation, missing only two games and scoring 13 times, including two apiece in away wins at Metz and Toulouse.\r\n\r\nOn 15 September 2018 during the 2018–19 Ligue 1 season, Pépé scored a hat-trick, including two penalties, in the 3–2 away win over Amiens. Days later, it was confirmed by club president Gérard Lopez that FC Barcelona were among several clubs that were interested in signing him. On 14 April 2019, Pépé scored a goal and provided two assists in the 5–1 home win over Paris Saint-Germain. He finished the 2018-19 Ligue 1 season with 22 goals, second only to PSG's Kylian Mbappé, with 11 assists, and was named in the UNFP Team of the Year.\r\n\r\nOn 26 July 2019, it was announced that Serie A side S.S.C. Napoli had agreed a £71.7 million pound fee with Lille.\r\n\r\nArsenal\r\nOn 1 August 2019, it was announced that Pépé had joined Premier League club Arsenal in a club-record fee of €79 million (£72 million), eclipsing the previous record of €62 million for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Upon signing for Arsenal, he was handed the number 19 shirt.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nPépé was born in France to parents of Ivorian descent. He received a callup to the Ivory Coast national football team in November 2016, and was an unused substitute in the goalless draw away to Morocco in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification on 12 November. He made his debut three days later in a friendly of the same score against his birth nation France at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis in Lens, playing the final four minutes in place of Max-Alain Gradel.\r\n\r\nPépé was named in Michel Dussuyer's 23-man squad for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon, but took no part as the Elephants were eliminated from their group.\r\n\r\nOn 24 March 2018, in a friendly against Togo in France, Pépé scored his first international goals in the first half of a 2–2 draw. He followed it three days later with another goal in a 2–1 win against Moldova in the same stadium.\r\n\r\nStyle of play\r\nPépé is known as a pacey and skilled attacking winger who is comfortable on both flanks, but usually plays on the right wing cutting onto his left foot, he was also converted by former head coach at Lille OSC Marcelo Bielsa to play as a striker.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strSide":"Left","strPosition":"Winger","strCollege":null,"strFacebook":"","strWebsite":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strYoutube":"","strHeight":"6 ft 0 in","strWeight":"","intLoved":"0","strThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/thumb\/4vb8tl1564693133.jpg","strCutout":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/cutout\/w3jqvg1565815872.png","strRender":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/render\/0f4uq41564918309.png","strBanner":null,"strFanart1":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCreativeCommons":"No","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idPlayer":"34148405","idTeam":"134553","idTeamNational":null,"idSoccerXML":"1013","idPlayerManager":null,"strNationality":"Colombia","strPlayer":"Jherson Vergara","strTeam":"Arsenal Tula","strTeamNational":null,"strSport":"Soccer","intSoccerXMLTeamID":"75","dateBorn":"1994-05-26","strNumber":null,"dateSigned":"2013-07-01","strSigning":"Loan (Milan)","strWage":"","strOutfitter":null,"strKit":null,"strAgent":null,"strBirthLocation":"Florida","strDescriptionEN":"Jherson Vergara Amú (born 26 May 1994) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays as a centre back for FC Arsenal Tula on loan from Milan.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strSide":null,"strPosition":"Defender","strCollege":null,"strFacebook":"","strWebsite":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strYoutube":"","strHeight":"1.90","strWeight":"0","intLoved":"0","strThumb":null,"strCutout":null,"strRender":null,"strBanner":null,"strFanart1":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCreativeCommons":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
