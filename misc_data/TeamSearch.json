After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later they won the council's approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Arsène Wenger described this as the \"biggest decision in Arsenal's history\" since the board appointed Herbert Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates Airline was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. Work was completed in 2006 at a cost of £390 million.","strStadiumLocation":"Holloway, London","intStadiumCapacity":"60338","strWebsite":"www.arsenal.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/Arsenal","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/arsenal","strInstagram":"instagram.com\/arsenal","strDescriptionEN":"Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Holloway, London which currently plays in the Premier League, the highest level of English football.

Milita nella massima serie del calcio inglese ininterrottamente dal 1919-1920, risultando quindi la squadra da più tempo presente in First Division\/Premier League. È la prima squadra della capitale del Regno Unito per successi sportivi e, in ambito federale, la terza dopo Manchester United e Liverpool, essendosi aggiudicata nel corso della sua storia tredici campionati inglesi, dodici FA Cup (record di vittorie, condiviso con il Manchester United), due League Cup e quattordici Community Shield (una condivisa),[5] mentre in ambito internazionale ha conquistato una Coppa delle Coppe ed una Coppa delle Fiere. Inoltre è una delle tredici squadre che hanno raggiunto le finali di tutte le tre principali competizioni gestite dalla UEFA: Champions League (2005-2006), Coppa UEFA (1999-2000) e Coppa delle Coppe (1979-1980, 1993-1994 e 1994-1995).[6]\r\n\r\nI colori sociali, rosso per la maglietta e bianco per i pantaloncini, hanno subìto variazioni più o meno evidenti nel corso degli anni. Anche la sede del club è stata cambiata più volte: inizialmente la squadra giocava a Woolwich, ma nel 1913 si spostò all'Arsenal Stadium, nel quartiere di Highbury; dal 2006 disputa invece le sue partite casalinghe nel nuovo Emirates Stadium. Lo stemma è stato modificato ripetutamente, ma al suo interno è sempre comparso almeno un cannone. Proprio per questo motivo i giocatori ed i tifosi dell'Arsenal sono spesso soprannominati Gunners (in italiano \"cannonieri\").\r\n\r\nL'Arsenal conta su una schiera di tifosi molto nutrita, distribuita in ogni parte del mondo. Nel corso degli anni sono sorte profonde rivalità con i sostenitori di club concittadini, la più sentita delle quali è quella con i seguaci del Tottenham Hotspur, con i quali i Gunners giocano regolarmente il North London derby.[7] L'Arsenal è anche uno dei club più ricchi del mondo, con un patrimonio stimato di 1,3 miliardi di dollari, secondo la rivista Forbes nel 2014, facendone il quinto club più ricco del pianeta e il secondo in Inghilterra.[8]","strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/a1af2i1557005128.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133604-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/q2mxlz1512644512.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xyusxr1419347566.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qttspr1419347612.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uwssqx1420884450.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qtprsw1420884964.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/rtpsrr1419351049.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/ArsenalTour","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134430","idSoccerXML":"435","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Arsenal Kyiv","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"2001","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Ukrainian Premier League","idLeague":"4354","strDivision":null,"strManager":"Andriy Annenkov","strStadium":"Dynamo Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"Kolos Stadium is a multifunctional facility, primarily used for football and field hockey located in Boryspil, Kiev Oblast, Ukraine.

The original club was established in 1925, to which today's club traces its roots. The Arsenal team that was re-founded in 2001 went bankrupt in late 2013, but the club was soon reformed and currently plays as an amateur team in the Kiev City League competition. The club is planning to return to professional football..\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s, a different club under the same name Arsenal Kiev, established in 1925 as a team of the Arsenal Factory in Kiev, won the 1958 Ukrainian SSR Championship under the name of Mashynobudivnyk Kiev. However in 1963 the club was renamed Temp Kiev. In 1964 the club was replaced by Dynamo-2 Kyiv in the Soviet Second League and ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the contemporary Arsenal club is disputed; some consider it to be part of the CSKA Kyiv heritage, others - of FC Boryspil. In 1994 CSKA merged with FC Boryspil under the name CSKA-Borysfen Boryspil (soon thereafter - CSKA-Borysfen Kyiv). After a series of successful seasons FC Boryspil made its way from the Ukrainian Third League to the Ukrainian First League before the merge, while CSKA prior to that was relegated in two seasons from the Ukrainian First League to the Ukrainian Third League. The original CSKA team became a farm team (CSKA-2) of the merged CSKA-Borysfen. The newly merged team advanced to the top flight (from the First League to the Higher League) in one season. Since the 1995–96 season, the club has continuously competed in the top flight.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 CSKA-Borysfen went through another transformation when it split into two different clubs: CSKA Kyiv and Borysfen Boryspil. The management of CSKA-Borysfen decided to recreate a club in Boryspil, while CSKA was reorganized by the Ministry of Defense as the first team of CSKA. Simultaneously, the actual CSKA that was competing at the lower division won a promotion and was later reorganized as the second team, CSKA-2. Borysfen after competing at the amateur level of the Kyiv Oblast applied to enter the professional competitions and gained entry to the lower divisions of the championship.\r\n\r\nThe army-men also managed to appear in the domestic cup's finals twice (1998 and 2001), where they lost both times: first against city-rivals Dynamo Kyiv and then against Shakhtar Donetsk. The club's greatest achievements include a successful UEFA Cup run in the season of 2001–02, defeating the now defunct Finnish side Jokerit and Serbian giants Red Star Belgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter the 2000 financial crisis at CSKA, the club, as a state company of the Sports Committee of Ministry of Defense, had its budget cut and was on the brink of being dissolved. The Kyiv city government on the initiative of Oleksandr Omelchenko bought the club in 2001 reorganizing it under the name of 'Arsenal', grandfathering everything from CSKA Kyiv. The First League second team CSKA-2 Kyiv continued to be affiliated with the Ministry of Defense and once again became the primary team of the Army football club, FC CSKA Kyiv.\r\n\r\nWhile under the city government's ownership, Arsenal struggled financially, resorting to loaning many of its first team's squad players. The city had decreased funding to the club significantly as it sought to reduce its numerous sports holdings. In May 2007, it was announced that the club would be demoted due to financial issues, however soon afterwards it was revealed that Arsenal would be purchased by Ukrainian oligarch, Vadim Rabinovich. The new owner started actively financing the club and its transfers. In January 2009 the Mayor of Kiev Leonid Chernovetskyi bought Arsenal Kyiv for 1 hryvnia from Rabynovich; Chernovetskiy's 30-year-old son Stepan became the club's president. The following year Rabynovich bought the club back due to the poor management.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":"Arsenal Kiev (en ucraniano: ФК \"Арсенал\" Київ) fue un club de fútbol profesional situado en Kiev, capital de Ucrania.\r\n\r\nFue fundado en 2001 cuando el ayuntamiento de Kiev compró el CSKA de Kiev, que entonces competía en la Liga Premier de Ucrania, y lo mantuvo hasta que en 2007 el empresario Vadim Rabinovich asumió su control.
